                    <p>Fish represent a broad class of aquatic animals that can live in fresh or saltwater, depending on the species. Bringing fish into your home can be an exciting hobby, especially if you intend to breed them, and the presence of a fish tank in your home can induce feelings of peace and tranquility. </p>
                    <p>Whether you are bringing your fish home for the first time or maintaining your aquarium, it is important to test your water <b>once per week</b> to ensure it is free from toxins that can harm your fish. </p>

Follow these general water chemistry guidelines to ensure your fish will adapt well to your aquarium and avoid ingesting toxins that can harm or kill your fish: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>pH Level: 6.8–7.6 (7.0 is considered neutral) </p></li>
                        <li><p>Ammonia: any level above zero is harmful to fish </p></li>
                        <li><p>Nitrates: 5 to 10 ppm </p></li>
                        <li><p>Nitrites: less than 0.5 ppm </p></li>

                        <li><p>Ammonia: any level above 0.1 ppm requires attention </p></li>
                        <li><p>Nitrates: 10 to 40 ppm </p></li>
                        <li><p>Nitrites: less than 0.2 ppm </p></li>
