                Pets are nature's gift to humanity. 
                It has been scientifically proven that opening our homes and hearts to a pet increases our longevity and improves our overall quality of life as well as the lives of our pets.

                They offer one-on-one consultations with current and prospective pet owners as well as group presentations designed for veterinary, pet shelter, and pet breeding professionals.
